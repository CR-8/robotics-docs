# Autonomous Systems

Master the technologies that enable robots to operate independently without human intervention. This section covers advanced topics in robot autonomy.

## Overview

Autonomous systems can perceive their environment, make decisions, and execute tasks without human operators. Key technologies include:

- **Navigation**: Path planning, SLAM, and obstacle avoidance
- **AI Logic**: Machine learning, decision-making, and behavior control
- **Sensor Fusion**: Combining multiple sensor inputs for robust perception

## What Makes a Robot Autonomous?

Fully autonomous robots can:
- Navigate unknown environments
- Detect and avoid obstacles
- Make intelligent decisions based on sensor data
- Learn and adapt to new situations
- Execute complex multi-step tasks

## Quick Start

Build autonomous capabilities:

1. [Navigation](/docs/autonomous/navigation) - Implement SLAM and path planning
2. [Sensor Fusion](/docs/autonomous/sensor-fusion) - Combine sensor data reliably
3. [AI Logic](/docs/autonomous/ai-logic) - Add intelligent decision-making
