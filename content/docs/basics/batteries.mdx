# Batteries

Selecting the right battery is crucial for robot performance, runtime, and safety.

## Battery Types

### Lithium Polymer (LiPo)
- **Pros**: High energy density, lightweight, high discharge rates
- **Cons**: Requires careful handling, can be dangerous if damaged
- **Use Cases**: Drones, combat robots, RC vehicles
- **Voltage**: 3.7V per cell (1S = 3.7V, 2S = 7.4V, 3S = 11.1V, etc.)

### Lithium-Ion (Li-ion)
- **Pros**: Safer than LiPo, good energy density
- **Cons**: Lower discharge rates, heavier
- **Use Cases**: Mobile robots, educational projects

### Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH)
- **Pros**: Safe, rechargeable, no memory effect
- **Cons**: Lower energy density, self-discharge
- **Use Cases**: Hobby robots, learning projects

## Key Specifications

- **Capacity (mAh)**: Total charge storage
- **Voltage (V)**: Nominal operating voltage
- **C-Rating**: Discharge rate capability
- **Energy (Wh)**: Capacity × Voltage

## Battery Safety

⚠️ **Important Safety Tips**:

1. Never overcharge or over-discharge
2. Use proper balance chargers for LiPo
3. Store at storage voltage (3.8V per cell)
4. Keep away from heat and punctures
5. Use fireproof LiPo bags

## Calculating Runtime

```
Runtime (hours) = Battery Capacity (mAh) / Current Draw (mA) × 1000
```

Example: 5000mAh battery with 2000mA draw = 2.5 hours

## Popular Battery Options

- **Turnigy**: Budget LiPo options
- **Gens Ace**: High-quality LiPo
- **Sony VTC6**: High-drain 18650 Li-ion
- **Panasonic Eneloop**: Best NiMH for robotics
