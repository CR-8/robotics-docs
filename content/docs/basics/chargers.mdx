# Battery Chargers

Proper charging equipment is essential for battery longevity and safety.

## Charger Types

### LiPo Balance Chargers

**Essential Features**:
- Cell balancing (ensures each cell charges equally)
- Multiple charging modes (balance, fast, storage)
- Voltage and current monitoring
- Safety cutoffs

**Popular Models**:
- **IMAX B6**: Budget-friendly, versatile
- **SkyRC iMAX B6AC**: Built-in AC adapter
- **HTRC T240**: Dual channel, touch screen

### USB Chargers

**For Li-ion 18650 Cells**:
- **Nitecore D4**: 4-bay intelligent charger
- **Xtar VC4**: LCD display, multiple chemistries
- **Use**: Portable projects, power banks

### Smart Chargers

- Auto-detection of battery type
- Microprocessor controlled
- Charge/discharge/cycle modes
- Data logging

## Charging Guidelines

### LiPo Charging
```
Charge Rate = Battery Capacity × C-Rating
Example: 5000mAh × 1C = 5A charging current
```

**Recommended**: Charge at 1C for longevity
**Fast Charge**: Up to 2C (reduces battery life)

### Storage Voltage
- **LiPo**: 3.8V per cell
- **Li-ion**: 3.7V per cell
- Store batteries at 40-60% charge for long-term storage

## Safety Features to Look For

✅ **Essential**:
- Overcharge protection
- Short circuit protection
- Reverse polarity protection
- Temperature monitoring
- Balance charging for LiPo

⚠️ **Safety Rules**:

1. Never leave charging batteries unattended
2. Charge on fireproof surfaces
3. Use correct settings for battery type
4. Check battery voltage before charging
5. Dispose of swollen/damaged batteries properly

## Charging Connectors

- **JST**: Small batteries (< 1000mAh)
- **XT60**: Medium batteries (1000-5000mAh)
- **XT90**: Large batteries (> 5000mAh)
- **Deans (T-Plug)**: High current applications

## Power Supplies

For bench charging:
- **12V PSU**: Most budget chargers
- **24V PSU**: High-power chargers
- **Minimum**: 5A output recommended
