# Basic Components

Learn about the fundamental building blocks of robotics systems. These components form the foundation of any robotics project.

## Overview

This section covers the essential hardware components you'll need to understand for robotics:

- **Motors**: The actuators that provide motion and mechanical power
- **Batteries**: Power sources that keep your robot running
- **Sensors**: Components that allow your robot to perceive its environment
- **Chargers**: Systems for safely recharging your batteries
- **Microcontrollers**: The "brains" that process information and control components

## Quick Start

If you're new to robotics, we recommend starting with:

1. [DC Motors](/docs/basics/motors) - Understand the fundamental actuators
2. [Batteries](/docs/basics/batteries) - Learn about power sources and selection
3. [Microcontrollers](/docs/basics/microcontrollers) - Get started with Arduino or ESP32
