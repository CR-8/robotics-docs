# Combat Robotics

Learn to design, build, and compete with combat robots. This section covers everything from chassis design to weapon systems and power management.

## Overview

Combat robotics is an exciting sport where robots battle in controlled arenas. Success requires knowledge of:

- **Chassis Design**: Structural engineering and material selection
- **Weapon Systems**: Spinners, flippers, crushers, and more
- **Power Management**: High-current battery systems and motor control

## Weight Classes

Combat robots compete in various weight classes:
- **Antweight**: 1 lb (454g)
- **Beetleweight**: 3 lb (1.36kg)
- **Hobbyweight**: 12 lb (5.44kg)
- **Featherweight**: 30 lb (13.6kg)
- **Lightweight**: 60 lb (27.2kg)
- **Middleweight**: 120 lb (54.4kg)
- **Heavyweight**: 250 lb (113.4kg)

## Quick Start

Build your first combat robot:

1. [Chassis Design](/docs/combat/chassis-design) - Learn structural fundamentals
2. [Weapon Systems](/docs/combat/weapons-system) - Choose and implement weapons
3. [Power Systems](/docs/combat/power) - Select batteries and ESCs

## Design Philosophy

### Offense vs Defense
- **Offensive**: Focus on weapon power and aggression
- **Defensive**: Prioritize armor and control
- **Balanced**: Mix of weapon capability and durability

### Common Strategies
- **Vertical Spinner**: High kinetic energy, devastating hits
- **Horizontal Spinner**: Wide attack range, good control
- **Flipper**: Control-oriented, strategic positioning
- **Wedge**: Defensive, deny opponent weapon access

## Essential Skills

- **CAD Design**: SolidWorks, Fusion 360 for modeling
- **Material Science**: Understanding metals, composites, and plastics
- **Electronics**: High-current wiring and motor control
- **Mechanical Engineering**: Weapon kinematics and forces
- **Strategy**: Arena awareness and driving techniques

## Safety Considerations

Combat robotics requires strict safety protocols:
- Removable links for weapon power
- Radio failsafes and proper setup
- Proper material selection for containment
- Tool safety for working with power tools
- Arena safety rules and regulations

## Competition Resources

- Find local competitions and builders groups
- Study rules for your chosen weight class
- Learn from successful designs (without copying)
- Practice driving and combat tactics
- Build a support team for competition day
