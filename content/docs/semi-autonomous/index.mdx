# Semi-Autonomous Systems

Explore control algorithms and wireless systems that enable semi-autonomous robot operation. These technologies bridge the gap between manual control and full autonomy.

## Overview

Semi-autonomous systems combine human input with automated control algorithms to create responsive, intelligent robot behavior. This section covers:

- **Control Algorithms**: PID, state machines, and feedback control systems
- **Wireless Systems**: RF, Bluetooth, WiFi, and LoRa communication

## What is Semi-Autonomous?

Semi-autonomous robots can:
- Execute pre-programmed behaviors while accepting operator input
- Maintain stability and control through automated feedback loops
- Communicate wirelessly with operators or other systems
- Assist operators by handling low-level control tasks

## Quick Start

Start building semi-autonomous capabilities:

1. [Control Algorithms](/docs/semi-autonomous/control-algos) - Master PID and state machines
2. [Wireless Systems](/docs/semi-autonomous/wireless-systems) - Implement reliable communication
